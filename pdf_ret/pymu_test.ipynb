      "IV. TECHNICAL APPROACH\n",
      "In this section we begin by describing the analytical\n",
      "approach that led to development and implementation of a\n",
      "handcrafted control policy. We then discuss how this control\n",
      "policy was ﬁne-tuned based on simulation results in order\n",
      "to act as an expert trajectory generator for the imitation\n",
      "learning. The ﬁnal subsection describes the imitation learning\n",
      "formulation.\n",
      "Initially, several DRL methods were used in place of imita-\n",
      "tion learning. From these preliminary experiments we learned\n",
      "that the space of successful policies, not necessarily optimal,\n",
      "was especially small. This becomes a critical problem in\n",
      "DRL given large policy spaces since signiﬁcant exploration\n",
      "is necessary. Instead, we elected to pursue imitation learning\n",
      "which proved to be both effective and efﬁcient.\n",
      "A. Analysis\n",
      "Manipulating an object through rolling contact can be\n",
      "viewed as navigating the rollers on the object. Therefore,\n",
      "an object transformation can be achieved by navigating the\n",
      "rollers from their initial contact locations to the desired ﬁnal\n",
      "contact locations. While there is no unique solution for the\n",
      "paths the rollers take during their navigation for given initial\n",
      "and ﬁnal grasping poses, it is possible to solve, on this\n",
      "\n",

      "Reference frames of each of the three joints within each\n",
      "ﬁnger, relative to the base coordinate system. Dashed lines indicate neutral\n",
      "positions from which joint angles are measured.\n",
      "non-holonomic system, for the instantaneous joint velocities\n",
      "based on known object geometry, object pose, object veloc-\n",
      "ity, and contact conditions (rolling without slipping).\n",
      "Object geometry and pose are necessary to calculate the\n",
      "contact locations, which determine the relationship between\n",
      "joint motions and given contact motions on the rollers (the\n",
      "contact jacobian matrix). This information can subsequently\n",
      "be used to map the desired object motion to the motions\n",
      "at the contact point on the object. Applying the contact\n",
      "condition of rolling without slipping means that the contact\n",
      "velocity on the object and the contact velocity on the roller\n",
      "are equal. Thus, inverse kinematics can be used to calculate\n",
      "the joint velocities required for a desired object motion, a\n",
      "process similar to the calculation of geometric stiffness for\n",
      "grasping presented in [33].\n",
      "The problem is formulated as follows: given the object’s\n",
      "initial and target position and orientation, compute the con-\n",
      "tact location and contact motion on the roller, and then\n",
      "compute the pivot joint orientation and motions of the base\n",
      "and roller joints.\n",
      "Given the desired motion of the object and known contact\n",
      "locations, we can obtain the contact motion by\n",
      "Fig. 5.\n",
      "Contact motion breaks down to two components\n",
      "δxcontact = Jobjδxobj\n",
      "(1)\n",
      "where Jobj is the jacobian matrix mapping object motion to\n",
      "the motion at the contact frame.\n",
      "On the other hand, with the contact motion δxcontact, the\n",
      "object position xobj, and roller position xroller all known,\n",
      "the contact motion can be interpreted as the motion at the\n",
      "contact location due to the movement of the 3 joints:\n",
      "δxcontact = Jθδθ\n",
      "(2)\n",
      "Where Jθ is the contact jacobian matrix for mapping ﬁnger\n",
      "joint motions to motions in the contact coordinates, and\n",
      "δθ is a vector of joint motions of the ﬁnger. In many\n",
      "robotics applications δθ is determined directly by solving\n",
      "(2). However, this method is not particularly applicable to\n",
      "this gripper design for the following reasons:\n",
      "1) The contact locations are very close to the pivot joint\n",
      "so the ﬁnger is always close to a singularity.\n",
      "2) The pivot joint has a joint limit of [− π\n",
      "2 , π\n",
      "2 ] meaning\n",
      "that in many cases the instantaneous velocity required\n",
      "from the pivot joint to achieve the desired contact\n",
      "velocity cannot be reached.\n",
      "Therefore, instead of carrying out the full inverse kine-\n",
      "matics, we divide the contact motion into two components:\n",
      "the component resulting from the motion of the base joint,\n",
      "δxcb, and the component resulting from the rolling, δxcr.\n",
      "The pivot joint is used to reorient the roller so that the\n",
      "rolling direction at the contact point is aligned with δxcr.\n",
      "This approximation is sufﬁcient because (1) when the contact\n",
      "locations are close to the pivot axis, the pivot motion does\n",
      "not have a signiﬁcant impact on the object motion, and (2)\n",
      "the object being grasped is over constrained by the three\n",
      "ﬁngers, so using the soft ﬁnger model [34] to approximate\n",
      "roller contacts, the torque exerted by pivoting is compensated\n",
      "by the lateral frictions from the two other ﬁngers. Thus, the\n",
      "singularity is advantageous in that it enables sole use of the\n",
      "pivot joint to align the roller in order to achieve δxcr.\n",
      "We developed a handcrafted control strategy based on\n",
      "the above formulation with some modiﬁcations that ﬁt the\n",
      "gripper design. The handcrafted control policy tested in\n",
      "simulation and on the hardware assumes that the object\n",
      "geometry is spherical with radius R. Speciﬁcally, the below\n",
      "calculations are for a single ﬁnger, but can be applied to\n",
      "the two other ﬁngers as well. For the simplicity of notation,\n",
      "we use subscript 1, 2, and 3 to represent the base joint,\n",
      "pivot joint, and roller joint, respectively, and leave out the\n",
      "subscript A, B or C because the following derivation would\n",
      "be identical for each ﬁnger.\n",
      "In order to obtain δxcb and δxcr, we need to project\n",
      "δxcontact onto Z2 and the contact plane (Fig. 5). The contact\n",
      "plane can be described by its normal vector ⃗ncon:\n",
      "ˆncon =\n",
      "xobj − xroller\n",
      "||xobj − xroller||2\n",
      "(3)\n",
      "Using the fact that δxcr is orthogonal to ˆncon and is also\n",
      "in the plane formed by δxcb and δxcontact, we can compute\n",

      "Unfortunately, placing a greater emphasis on controlling\n",
      "the object position was seen to cause previously successful\n",

      "work across all observed successes. On the other hand,\n",
      "the imitation learning was better for a couple of potential\n",

      "Therefore, instead of carrying out the full inverse kine-\n",
      "matics, we divide the contact motion into two components:\n",
      "the component resulting from the motion of the base joint,\n",
      "dxcb, and the component resulting from the rolling, dxcr.\n",
      "The pivot joint is used to reorient the roller so that the\n",

      "This approximation is sufficient because (1) when the contact\n",
      "locations are close to the pivot axis, the pivot motion does\n",
      "not have a significant impact on the object motion, and (2)\n",
      "the object being grasped is over constrained by the three\n",
      "fingers, so using the soft finger model [34] to approximate\n",
      "roller contacts, the torque exerted by pivoting is compensated\n",
      "by the lateral frictions from the two other fingers. Thus, the\n",
      "singularity is advantageous in that it enables sole use of the\n",

      "We developed a handcrafted control strategy based on\n",
      "the above formulation with some modifications that fit the\n",

      "A potential explanation for the poorer performance of the\n",

      "components, taking a linear path can lead to the gripper\n",

      "desired axis of rotation, one or more of the rollers can\n",

      "the object. This problem can be mitigated by increasing\n",
      "the positional error compensation in the closed-loop control\n",
      "method in order to more actively control the object height.\n",
      "Unfortunately, placing a greater emphasis on controlling\n",
      "the object position was seen to cause previously successful\n",
      "trajectories to fail. No combination of gains was seen to\n",
      "work across all observed successes. On the other hand,\n",
      "the imitation learning was better for a couple of potential\n",
